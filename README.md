##  Important Note on Firmware Versions

Elektron devices evolve. A trick that worked in OS 1.10 might be obsolete in OS 1.20.
Please check the badges at the top of every guide:

- ![OS 1.20+](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-1.20%2B-success?style=flat-square): Confirmed working on the latest firmware.
- ![OS Legacy](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-Legacy-orange?style=flat-square): Works on older firmware, but there might be a better way now.
