## The Mission
The official manual is great for telling you *what* a button does.
**This repository is for everything else.**

We focus on:
* **Creative Misuse:** Using tools in ways they weren't designed for.
* **Workarounds:** How to achieve things the firmware "officially" can't do (yet).
* **Deep Sound Design:** Synthesis techniques beyond simple sampling.
* **Workflow Hacks:** Muscle memory shortcuts for live performance.

> **Note:** If you are looking for basic operations (e.g., "How do I save a project?"), please refer to the official [Elektron Manual](https://www.elektron.se/support). We start where the manual ends.

##  Important Note on Firmware Versions

Elektron devices evolve. A trick that worked in OS 1.10 might be obsolete in OS 1.20.
Please check the badges at the top of every guide:

- ![OS 1.20+](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-1.20%2B-success?style=flat-square): Confirmed working on the latest firmware.
- ![OS Legacy](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-Legacy-orange?style=flat-square): Works on older firmware, but there might be a better way now.
